## Details



The Shared Utilities component serves as a foundational layer within the nonadditivity project, providing a centralized collection of reusable helper functions and common functionalities. It encapsulates various cross-cutting concerns, including mathematical operations, logging, error handling, type definitions, command-line interface helpers, and specific utilities for the classification workflow. This modular design promotes code reusability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns, aligning with the project's emphasis on a highly modular and cohesive architecture. By abstracting these common functionalities, the core business logic remains cleaner and more focused.



### Mathematical Utilities

Provides a collection of common mathematical functions and statistical operations. These are fundamental for numerical computations across various parts of the application, especially for calculating non-additivity metrics and statistical properties in the core logic and output generation.

### Classification Helper Utilities

Offers utility functions specifically tailored for the classification workflow, including general data manipulation, validation checks for atom indices and matches, and cheminformatics-specific conversions like SMARTS to SMILES. These functions support the various classification modules by providing common, reusable logic.
